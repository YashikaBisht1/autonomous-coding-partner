## 🔥 KEY_FEATURES

### 🧠 Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Planner Agent**: Architecting complex blueprints from simple prompts.
- **Developer Agent**: Generating production-ready code across multiple stacks.
- **Tester Agent**: Autonomously creating unit tests for every file.
- **Fixer Agent**: Real-time debugging and self-healing when tests fail.

### 🌍 Multi-Stack Agnostic
- Full support for **Python**, **Node.js (JS/TS)**, and **Go**.
- **Auto-Dependency Management**: The agents detect required libraries and run `pip install` or `npm install` automatically in the background.

### ⚡ Cyberpunk UI/UX
- VS Code inspired **Integrated Terminal**.
- Glassmorphic panels with Neopink glow effects.
- Real-time updates via **WebSockets** for zero-latency feedback.
